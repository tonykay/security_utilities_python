## Overview

Simple series of security utilities inspired by [Zsecurity](https://zsecurity.org/).
More for learning than anything else and if you need a network scanner for example stick with `nmap` or your current favorite.

All python3, all using mainly standard libs as much as possible.

### Tools

* `arp_spoof` - Very simple but working arp spoofer
* `info_gather` - Basic header retrieval use curl or httpie (`http`) instead
* `mac_address_changer` - Basic MAC address changer
* `network_scanner` - Network Scanner, but I'd use `nmap`...
